Their health educators work to destigmatize HIV and AIDS in the Kweneng district and beyond. \n\n     TBC's founder Stanley Monageng is a tireless advocate and Treat All Champion. The film Ke mo Leseding follows Stanley Monageng as he undertakes a 400-kilometer trek throughout Botswana to raise awareness of HIV treatment, and destigmatize HIV and AIDS, and educate Batswana on the latest treatment for the disease."

Both during and after COVID-19 evacuated the volunteers, Peace Corps continued to work with Thusang Bana Centre to bring Ke mo Leseding to Batswana.\n\n     Paul O'Brien and Isaac Devoid supported Thusang Bana Centre and Stanley Monageng during the 12 days that make up the bulk of the footage used to create Ke mo Leseding. Both are now RPCVs - Returned Peace Corps Volunteers - but continue to develop Ke mo Leseding because of TBC's inspiring message and Stanley's tireless commitment."
